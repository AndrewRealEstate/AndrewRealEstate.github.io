							<h3>Real Estate Agent</h3>
							<p>I've helped 60+ clients over the past few years purchase or sell their home using my <strong>Georgia Real Estate License</strong>. If you're interested in buying a home in Georgia or in selling your own home, I'm happy to take care of that for you. If you would like additional information on how to <strong>work with me</strong> as your own personal Real Estate agent, <strong>please use the contact form above</strong>. In addition to Agency, I also work with peers who are making their way in Real Estate. I'm happy to hear what you are working on or are planning. If you're seeking advice on ground-up construction, permitting/zoning municipal work, architecture/design, general contracting, or simply Atlanta market knowledge, I may be able to help speed your goals along.</p>

							<h3>Meet Andrew</h3>
							<p>I grew up coloring landscape drawings with paint pens as a child, learning AutoCAD 3D in grade school, completed Georgia Tech with a Civil Engineering Degree (best in the world), and have been a serial entrepreneur since before I can remember. I've lived in Georgia and Atlanta my entire life. I've been working in the real estate industry for almost 8 years now and have personally remodeled really old historic downtown buildings, fix and flipped a couple single family residential properties, and do all my own work - design, contracting, labor, purchasing, selling, etc.. all of it. I help friends and clients buy and sell their homes to maintain access to all of the resources of my real estate license. But enough about me, tell me about yourself. Please <strong>use the contact form link above</strong> to get started and tell me about your Real Estate goals. I'm sure I am able to help.</p>

											<blockquote>"I used Andrew 2 years ago to help me find a house. I’ve used several realtors before him with buying and selling properties and he is hands down the best I’ve worked with. What did it for me was he really understood and listened to what I was looking for and worked around the clock until we found the perfect fit. He was so sharp and had such a deep understanding of the market we decided to use him to sell one of our other properties during the pandemic. He was successful with this deal also. Admirable guy!"</blockquote>

He was there to coach us through everything from negotiating with the sellers, to closing with the attorneys. I would recommend him to anyone who is serious about buying a home because I am confident that he will do as incredible a job for you as he did for us."</blockquote>
